We've been in a bit of a transition period, trying to get our new stuff up and running. What that basically means is that, with the promise of better, new, and faster technology we get lazy. But fear not! For E3 is just around the corner and we'll be posting like nobody's business. Who knows, we might even have the new site up before then.



Now you're probably wondering what this "Project LMAV" might be. Well simple put it's going to be how to guide to surviving on your own without the assistance of a society. Be it, you just want to break free from everything and the modern world and decide to live by what you make and cultivate. Or, more realistically, there's a zombie invasion and we're all living in a post apocalyptic world.



With that being said you can expect a post from Lucas, as a preview of what the project will be about. More on LMAV in the coming weeks.
