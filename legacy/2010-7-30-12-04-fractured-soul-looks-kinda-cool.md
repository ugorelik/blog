I doubt anyone has heard of this game, seeing how the developers are still looking for a publisher. It looks really old school, I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. Oh well, check out their first gameplay footage release. You can almost tell just by looking at this game that you will either die a lot or just learn the mechanic very well.
