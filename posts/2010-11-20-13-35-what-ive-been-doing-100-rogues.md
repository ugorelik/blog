I've been playing 100 Rogues, an iPhone game/app. It's pretty sweet. Actually I'm not playing right now because my battery can't keep up and my phone is currently charging. What is 100 Rogues? It's a new take on an RPG game for the mobile platform. It has this arcadey feel to it without the burden a traditional RPG carries.



When I start a new RPG I pretty much have to min/max, I just feel bad if I don't. For those of you that don't know what min/max'ing is, it's pretty much just optimizing your character, i.e. making them perfect. But in 100 Rogues is different. Have you ever played Diablo? Ok now think playing Diablo but on hardcore mode. That is, every time you die you lose everything and have to restart the entire game.



But that's okay, because this game isn't about completion but rather sore. I think i've died about 10 times already and restarted 10 times but it's no less fun. Also there's no trash loot in this game, everything you pick up matters. I'm not going to go into too much detail right now though, expect something in the near future when I can actually stop playing long enough to write something decent about 100 Rogues.
