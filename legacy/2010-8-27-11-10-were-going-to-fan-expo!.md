I don't know why we haven't been mentioning this earlier, but we're going to FanExpo! Actually we're already on our way to Toronto as I write this. It's myself, Seva and a pal Joey who's going to be doing most of our video work. I'm not really too sure on what's going to be there actually (well William Shatner and G4 people), but I'm gonna go ahead and assume it's really similar to Comicon.



Hopefully we'll see some new content that we haven't seen before (and maybe grope some celebrities). That kinda segways into my next point. As some of you may have noticed, the actual content on JOYBLIND has been lacking. Like we pretty much missed all of Gamescom* Germany. Yeah... Well once we get back into the rhythm of things JOYBLIND should resume to it's regular awesomeness.



Well that's it for now, expect a bunch of content from FanExpo later today and throughout the weekend! PS: iPhone tethering is awesome.
