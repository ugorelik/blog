I was skeptical about New Vegas. I mean it's made by Obsidian which doesn't have the greatest track record (second half of KOTOR 2 among others) and I tend to stray away from games that are made from what a (usually) better company has developed (Black-Ops anyone?).



I eventually cracked (thanks to my buddy Eric) and bought New Vegas. And it's pretty cool so far. I'm about 4-5 hours my second play through (don't worry my first one only lasted 4 hours). Now I'm not going to compare New Vegas to Fallout Out 3 like everyone else seems to be doing. I'm going to try and treat it as it's own game. Heck maybe I won't do much comparing at all.



I have to say that it does stay true to the Fallout 3 formula, which is actually a good thing, I loved Fallout 3! Except this time there even more to do! But I've heard complaints that, even though the world is bigger, it's not much fuller. That is to say the content is bland. I haven't really found this to be true though, but then again I'm not very far.



And now for some negatives. The graphics. Man they suck, I mean like wow they're so bad. Like what is original xbox? The world is so god damn ugly it hurts. But I had the chance to check out the PC version for a little bit which seemed to look a little better so it's probably just the consoles.



If you liked Fallout 3 and are contemplating whether or not you should get New Vegas I'd say go for it. Make sure you take the Wild Wasteland perk, it should have been enable by default.
