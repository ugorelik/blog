I have one of those exams coming up where I'm pretty much lost in what I have to know. I find that with these exams, it can be hard to find a starting point (especially with ~580 slides of notes).

``` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
pages = 588
loop do
  number = (rand * pages).to_i
  `echo #{number} | tr -d "\n" | pbcopy`
  print "Go to #{number}!"
  gets
end
```

So this script picks a random page for me and I just go for it. Neat.
