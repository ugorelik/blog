I started playing the first Dead Space with Seva the other week. Before I couldn't bring myself to do it because that games is just too damn scary. But once you actually get into it, it's not that bad. I mean, there are only so many times a corpse can jump you. And this isn't a bad thing, I don't know about you but I don't like being stressed when I game.



This video of Dead Space 2 shows off the reward you get from finishing the game on hardcore mode. It's one of those foam fingers you get from sports events named the hand cannon (possible RE4 reference?). Every time Isaac fires this weapon he says "Bang!" and then it's followed by devastating damage. Just from watching the video you can tell that it pretty much turns the game from this terrifying heart pounding game, to something you can giggle at. But I guess once you've beat the game there's not much else they can throw at you.



As seen on Joystiq.
