I'm a little worried about Deus Ex Human revolution, but I'm not exactly sure why. I feel like this should be a heavy hitting triple A game, but where's the hype train? I need my, "Look at all the cool things we've done" video or the, "Hey look how many ways you can do X" video.



Considering the first game was a pretty big success and the second was somewhat disliked and the third now being made by a different studio and without Mr. Spector this game doesn't have a whole lot going for it. Well, I have to admit the CGI trailers have been pretty fancy and I've said multiple times to myself that I wouldn't mind this being a movie, but in the end it's just CGI.



Yes there has been a first gameplay video but that was like one and half minutes of in game cinematic and then like 20 seconds of actual game which was dragging a body, going through a vent and then shooting at some guys.







But again I'm not too sure why I'm so worried about this game. I mean I haven't even played the first two (well I've played the second one for about 30 minutes on Xbox way back). Maybe I'm just excited for something "new."



Oh and here's an extended version of the trailer. It's pretty amazing.
