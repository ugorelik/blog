We've got a lot of footage from first couple of days of FanExpo 2010. And I mean a lot. We've have a nice mini interview with Victor Lucas, host on Reviews on the Run and we probably have around three hours of of just QA with Felicia Day and Tommy Tallarico. Oh and then another hour of just B-Roll. Sifting through and editing the videos is going pretty slow.



So today we decided to get super serious and get as much work done as possible. And this is what we ended up with.
