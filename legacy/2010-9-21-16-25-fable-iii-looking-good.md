I haven't had the best experience with the Fable series. The first Fable I just did not like. When I got the second, I almost didn't give it a chance because it got mixed into my gaming queue. I did however try to play it and like it. Then of course my Xbox red ring'd and I haven't touched it since. During E3 we ran into a Mr. Ted Timmins who showed us Fable 3. To be honest I didn't see anything that new, but he did show us some cool stuff. And now with this video I'm getting a bit more excited about Fable III. You can get Fable III on the 29th of October.
