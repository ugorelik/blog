About a month ago a stumbled on an image. Actually the image above. I thought it was just some cool little art experiment/project. I browsed the site a bit more and found some similar pictures. "Well that was fun," I thought, and couple days later I forgot all about it.



The other day I found myself watching a video that had very similar artwork to the images that I had seen a while back. Lo and behold what I was looking at was art for a game. I even remember thinking something along the lines of, "Man that would be some sweet artwork for a game."







If you check out their [website][3] you can probably tell why I didn't discover this at first. It's pretty god damn cryptic. From what I've managed to gather, this game is being developed by three entities. [Superbrothers][4] who is (yes it's one guy) responsible for the artwork. [Capybara games][5], which is a pretty sweet and kinda indie studio. And Jim Gunthrie, who makes pretty music.



All in all this game looks pretty rad. Unfortunately I think that it's only coming out for the iPad. Also the developers seem more interested in cinematic properties of the game rather than intense gameplay. If it comes out for the iPhone, or even PC I'm already sold.
