I didn't really enjoy Hyrdophobia, which was a pretty big let-down since I had pretty high hopes. Like if Hyrdophobia were a whale it would probably beach itself.



But the other day I was informed (by Seva) that there had been a HUGE patch for Hydrophobia that apparently addresses a lot of issues. You know, one of those, "Hey this is what we should have released," patches. I'll have a go at it and hopefully win its place back in my heart.
