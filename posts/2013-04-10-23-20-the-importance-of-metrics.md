Recently we decided to refine our metrics. This included removing vanity metrics from our dashboard and focusing attention on metrics that made a direct impact on our current goals. 

#### Why are metrics important

To say that metrics are important is an understatement at best. In fact, I like to refer to metrics as the eyes of your company. Without them, you really are blind.

Being able to analyse your metrics based on what you do is invaluable information that can help shape a company or provide valuable feedback. For example, say we decided to try out a new strategy to increase our monthly usage; using our metrics dashboard we have real-time feedback on how effective the strategy is.

#### What does it all mean

While I was working on our metrics dashboard, I understood the importance of tracking our metrics and why we were doing it from a business perspective, but I also realized that these numbers reflect our impact on peoples lives. When someone moves down the funnel and into a user, there is realization of what that means. It means that another health professional is using something we made to provide better care to their patients. It feels good watching (via a slick dashboard) our product make an impact.
