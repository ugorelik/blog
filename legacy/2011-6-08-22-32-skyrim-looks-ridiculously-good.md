Well Skyrim just jumped to the top of my most wanted list. I'm still flabbergasted. The technology and the work that's going into this game is just phenomenal.



Hit the jump to find out why Skyrim looks and sounds so god damn good. Oh and there's a 13 minutes video of pure gameplay. Yeah.



The Elder Scrolls series has been an immensely successful. Yes, I know you Oblivion haters are out there, but that game still set the bar pretty high during its era. And all this with Bethesda's mediocre graphics, poor animation, shoddy voice acting, terrible faces and mediocre combat.



Now Skyrim is rocking a completely new engine (same engine as Rage) and it looks like everything has been improved upon. You can walk to wherever you see, the combat actually looks really fun, the character animation is good and the overall look and feel of the game just looks great. This is going to be a solid game of the year contender if not a sure thing.



#### Shouts Mechanic



Skyrim is going to have this nifty mechanic that lets you acquire powerful/game changing spells. These are called shouts. Basically how it works is that you find these shrines that have 'words,' once you get these words you can really do anything with them. To actually gain the ability you have to slay a dragon and get its soul. Once you have its soul you can invest it into one of your found words.



#### Other features



Aside from just improving on pretty much everything here are some "tangible" features. The game is said to have over 150 dungeons, all of which have been "hand crafted."



You get to kill dragons. Lots and lots of dragons. Actually killing dragons is probably going to be a key mechanic in the game due to the shout mechanic. Apparently dragons are random encounters (pretty beefy in the AI department), and will jump you in different situations. You can probably see them coming at you in the distance too or if you're far enough away you might be able to avoid them entirely.



Like I said earlier, the combat looks pretty cool. There's this new feature where you can dual wield weapons AND spells. Dual wielding a spell results in a more powerful version of that spell. Skyrim is also supposed to more of a classess based game where you just do what you want and practice at it.



And finally, the game is set to be released on...
