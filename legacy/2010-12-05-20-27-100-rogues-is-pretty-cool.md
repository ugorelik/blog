I like RPGs but I don't like RPGs on my iPhone with few exceptions. 100 Rogues is probably of those few. Most RPGs you'll find on the iOS are a bit too clunky for my liking or just have poor mechanics. Some other exceptions are Final Fantasy one and two, the Zenonia series and Dungeon Hunters. Although, these games did have their flaws. Zenonia was too long and demanded too much, Dungeon Hunters was great but had no replay value whatsoever, and well Final Fantasy is just Final Fantasy, I can't really say anything about a classic besides the fact that it's a classic.



Enter 100 Rogues. Now before I can really compare this to the others, I should probably describe how it works. In 100 Rogues you have one life. As I mentioned [previously][3], think Diablo II on hardcore mode. Actually I was a little surprised and angry when I first died and the game ended. But then I realized the beauty of this. Typically when I play an RPG I try to min/max. I spend about half an hour to an hour just looking up what works best, or what would suit my play style. In fact when I don't min/max and I'm not completely dominating one hundred percent of the time I feel like I'm doing something wrong. 100 Rogues gets rid of this. Every time you die you basically restart, time to try another build. The games own motto is that it's not about completion but rather the score you attain which really gives it that arcadey pick up and play feel.



Another cool thing about this game is the fact that there's virtually no trash loot. So you won't be picking up garbage, your character will benefit from virtually everything he or she picks up (except those few items that are class specific).



The difficulty curve for this game is actually quite steep. I only ever managed to get to the second floor of the third level. But I think that's a good thing, games should be challenging.



The game currently has two classes, the Crusader and the Fairy both with at least four popular builds. Developers Fusion Reactions are however promising two more classes with future updates. With beautiful art style, and with retro-arcadey look and feel, I highly recommend this game if you want something you can pick up and play at any time.
