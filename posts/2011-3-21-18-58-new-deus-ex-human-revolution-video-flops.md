When I first found this I was pretty excited -- I mean brand new gameplay for a game that I'm interested in? Awesome. But as I started watching the video, it kind of became bland. I mean there's nothing here that hasn't been done before. Walking up behind an enemy and doing a knock-out/kill? Nothing new. Shooting bad guys? Wooow. If anything this just made me want to play MGS4 or a non-butchered version of Splinter Cell.



Marry the narrator mentions that there are other, cooler ways of playing the game (social, hacking) but then decides it's better to focus on generic features that hundreds of games have. I mean cmon! Show me some combat show me the flow! How to I actually play this game and what can I do. It also would have been nice to see the benefits/consequences of choosing an approach. I mean why should I stealth if I can just pew pew my way through?



And on a final note stealth doesn't feel like stealth in first-person. Any FPS game that has implemented stealth I feel like I've just been pretending. Unless I am actively doing something different, like activating camo, it doesn't feel like stealth but rather more like you're just walking in different areas. Deus Ex gives off that same vibe. I'm hoping another video comes out soon with a better look at the game, because as of now I'm not sure I want to play it.
