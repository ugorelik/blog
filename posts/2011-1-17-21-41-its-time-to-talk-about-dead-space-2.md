Dead Space is on of those games that I pretend to like because it's a pretty damn fine game but I'm way, way, way too scared to play it on my own. It's on my, "I accept that fact that you're good, but I don't have time to play you," list. With that being said, I'm gonna try and get in on Dead Space 2. For some reason, know that millions of other people will be playing the game at the same time as me is a bit comforting.



As for the trailer itself, I don't know how I feel about Smashing Pumpkins' Bullet, but after watching it a second time (because it's awesome) I accepted it. Check it out after the break.
