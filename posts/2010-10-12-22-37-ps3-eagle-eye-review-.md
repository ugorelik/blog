The Eagle Eye (by Penguin United) is a pretty magical device, it lets you use a mouse and keyboard on your PS3. Cool idea right? Well let's see.



I have to admit I was somewhat sceptical when I heard about this device. I think my first thought was something along the lines of, "Now I can play like a mediocre PC gamer on consoles! Awesome." Well I guess that might not be a huge factor since apparently PC gamers completely [dominate console gamers][3] anyways (don't hurt me).



So with that in mind, I thought it would best to test on of the most popular genres/game: Modern Warfare 2. When I first played I was terribly disappointed. I just couldn't get the sensitivity high enough to actually play well enough. It would take me at least three shuffles just to turn around. Bunk. But then! I obtain a real (gaming) mouse with different DPI settings. And then everything changed.



I was actually so surprised that it translated my motions so accurately; aside from the graphics and minor control differences (which we'll talk about later) I couldn't tell the difference. I got my buddy Pat to do some testing as well, given that he's pretty pro at the PC version. And he too said that it performed fairly well.



Alright, let's get into some technical stuff. Once you purchase your Eagle Eye you have to set it up. This is all done fairly quickly and easily thanks to the software provided with the product. Once all of your keys are mapped, you're pretty much ready to go. The Eagle Eye can also store two different key mappings at once, so if you have different preferences for different genres it's good to go.



The few concerns I have with this devices is that you can't change the base sensitivity. So if you want to raise the sensitivity really high you better hope that the game you're playing supports a high sensitivity or that your mouse has DPI settings. Also you can't really fine tune any settings that aren't in the game. For instance in MW2 for PC you can click right mouse button to aim down the sites, and then click it again to stop. In the console versions you have to hold a the left trigger. So when you play using a mouse and keyboard on a console, you have to hold that right mouse button to continue aiming down the sites. That could take some getting used to. It's best to keep in mind that other games might have a similar kind of problem.



Another issue (probably the biggest one) was when Pat and I tried to use his super pro gaming keyboard. But for some reason that didn't want to work. Probably because of the keyboards drivers not being supported. So keep in mind that all of your pro gaming gear might not actually work.



Even with these minor issues the Eagle Eye still performs well enough to warrant a purchase. If you're like Lucas who doesn't own a console because he likes the mouse and keyboard combo too much then this is definitely for you. Also who knows, the Eagle Eye has an update feature that may one day fix everything that I've mentioned.
