I've always liked the Witcher series, even just the idea of it. In fact, last year I made it one of our goals to hunt down and find the Witcher 2 booth at E3. It was well worth it. During the presentation CD Projekt RED hinted that they had designed a engine that would work with consoles too, in fact the showcased the demo with an Xbox 360 controller. And today RED has announced that the Witcher 2 will be coming to the Xbox 360 in Q4 of 2011. No word on PS3.



The game looked pretty gosh darn good back then, and now it's kinda stupid how good it looks and how fun it is. And if you've heard anything about it game, yes, it is really hard at first. They could have done a much better job on the tutorial, by making it so you can't play it out of sequence, or just making the enemies straight up easier. I think I literally had to restart eight times. But eventually you get the hang of it and it becomes easier and more rewarding.



Oh and if you haven't heard, all DLC for The Witcher 2 will be free (excluding full blown expansions), and they've already patched it to include all available DLC. That's right you can too can get the pre-order bonuses and some even newer stuff. Continuing on CD Projekt RED's awesome streak, they have remove all DRM to help some folks having some issues and to increase overall performance.



I highly recommend you check this game out, it's well worth it even if you haven't played or beaten the first one (which you should also play).
