I don't know why but I'm pretty excited to play Codemasters' LOTRO. I played a free trial when LOTRO wasn't free to play and I have to say that it wasn't horrible. I think I got to level 7 on two characters or something before I got bored and quit. I think the fact that there was no PvP (player versus player) until the end game turned me off the most. So being the hard core WoW player that I was (am?) I obviously couldn't waste my time playing against NPCs and not pwning noobs.



The launch is scheduled for release tomorrow. Well that's what's been said. I was trying to find a place to fownload the client when I stumbled upon the news that LOTRO F2P would be delayed until who knows when. Well that's what one site posted, another said the European launch is only getting delayed. So who knows.



Hopefully I'll be able to play tomorrow morning and not have to wait another month.
