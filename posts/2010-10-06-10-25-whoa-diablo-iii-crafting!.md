It's been a while since we've heard anything from Diablo III. Well at least for me. So when I stumbled upon this video I was pretty excited. But honestly the content isn't too exciting but it does provide a detailed glimpse into the D3 crafting system.



First of all players can't craft; they have to get NPCs (artisans) to do it for them. By killing mobs you can find different recipes which your artisan can learn. The more you craft and build stuff the better your artisan will become (leveling the NPC). So it kinda is like the player is crafting, it's just done through a median which is the NPC. Nothing too ground breaking, the VO said that they wanted the player to focus on kill monster rather than spending time dealing with crafting. So essentially you're still doing the crafting, it's just separated from you...
