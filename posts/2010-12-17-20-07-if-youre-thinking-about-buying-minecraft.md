You should probably do it soon. As mentioned in Lucas Link 9, Minecraft is officially (finally) going into its beta. And with this, the promised price raise will come into effect, going from about 13 USD to 20 USD. But there's something else that's interesting. The folks over at Minecraft are also changing their policy.



Currently if you buy the game you are promised all future content that is made for the game for no cost. That's right anything that's Minecraft related that gets added as a download pack you get for free (apparently). But for those that opt to purchase the game after the beta will get no such perks.



Now I'm not too sure if this is actually a big thing. I mean every indie developer usually has the "You can have everything I ever do, just please, please help me feed my family" deal but now that Markus Persson probably realizes that he might be under selling himself (even if his game has made twice as much as some triple-A games like Red Dead Redemption) he'll start capitalizing on it more.



The reason I said that this may not be a big thing earlier is because this could just be a last attempt to get a little peak in their profit. To have people like me gawking about how you have to buy it now. I doubt that for the people that bought the game before the beta will even see a huge difference. It'll be strange if it's like, "Oh yeah I bought Minecraft pre-beta. I have $40 worth of content." In the long run, with tricky lawyers they can also bend and twist the rules by releasing special kinds of content that in some way won't count as updates or something. I don't know Markus Persson personally but from what he writes he doesn't really seem like the kind of person to do that.



In the end if you're thinking about getting Minecraft or you're waiting to the last possible second before you break, you have until December 20th. After that you can still buy it, but why delay the inevitable.
