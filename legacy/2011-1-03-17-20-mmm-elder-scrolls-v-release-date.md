New Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has a release date! Here's what Todd Howard had to say (I hugged him at E3).



"It's exciting finally to announce the game," said Todd Howard, Game Director on Skyrim. "We've been working for many years on Skyrim and the technology behind it. A new Elder Scrolls game has been a long time coming, and we can't wait to show it off."



I'm looking forward to this game especially since it's going to using a new engine and none of that bogus lame looking crap they've been peddling for the last decade. Just kidding Bethesda, I love you.



Oh the release date is 11/11/11 by the way.
