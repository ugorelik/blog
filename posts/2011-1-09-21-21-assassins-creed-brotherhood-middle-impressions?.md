Brotherhood? More like Assassin's Creed: Trample Pedestrians-hood. All you do in this game is trample over pedestrians with your horse. No, although that is a big part of the game (huge), this title actually delivers. It's like one of those situations where you order ice cream at the Ice-Cream Cafe (shut up they exist) and they screw up your simple order and pimp it out with sprinkles and caramel. And then they bring you another one. Seriously this game is that good.



So what's new you ask? Well the game is using the same engine and is based on the same story. It literally picks up exactly where you left off. Neither of these things are bad though, they've added enough content to really make this game shine. Okay, so what's really new. Well now you get your own liege of assassins! Looking at a target, raising your fist and watching an assassin pop out of the shadows and take out the person you were looking at does not get old. Some new gadgets like a poison bullet along with the ol' faithful double assassin blades. You can still build your 'empire' in the form of rebuilding Rome. This sounds like it's a recycled aspect but it's different enough to not feel stale.



As you keep playing this game you'll keep getting surprises. You get something new and you think, 'That's pretty neat.' and then that just keeps happening over and over again. Seeing how much I liked Assassin's Creed 2 so much it was hard for me to believe that Brotherhood could be so much better. That's not to say that Assassin's Creed 2 was lacking in anyway, this is just an impressive achievement.
