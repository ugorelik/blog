Battlefield 3 is just around the corner and there's already crazy drama. For those of you that don't know, Battlefield 3 will not be on Steam (not even a month later as it was rumored). Also, depending on where you pre-order your copy from, you'll get different items that may or may or may not break the game -- probably not.



I'm a little upset that I won't be able to add BF3 to my Steam collection but I'm sure I'll get over it since I just pre-ordered the game today. Don't want to go on a long rant about this whole Steam/EA feud and how I dislike origins so I thought I'd just link some Battlefield 3 Alpha footage.
