Fez is a game that I've been interested from the start. It's artsy and has a really original idea. The sheer polish that's going into this game is pretty amazing and it's definitely going to be a buy on launch day. Actually I don't think I've ever been this excited to play an arcade game.



Fez also helps us three-dimensional beings imagine what it would be like to see the fourth dimension by simulating a two-dimensional being with the ability to see the third dimension. It's pretty cool if you think about it.
