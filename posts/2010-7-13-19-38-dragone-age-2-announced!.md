![][3]Dragone Age 2 Announced!

So it's finally announced. Rumor had it was supposed to be shown at E3, but that didn't happen. But now it's here, and I'm kinda scared to be honest. 



This isn't quite the same Dragon Age that it used to be. Dragon Age 2 is seems like it will be a lot more like Mass Effect, that might rub some fans the wrong way. Dragon Age was a throw back to the old days of Baldur's Gate, but now that's all gone. 



Now personally, I like this new change. Instead of playing a nameless mute, you know play as a Human named Hawke. Hawke can we male or female, just like in Mass Effect, and will be fully voiced. I feel this will really add to the game since I for one never felt much of a connection with my great warrior. The fact that you're stuck being a human sucks a bit, but didn't affect either version of Mass Effect, so I'm sure BioWare can pull this one off fine.



Here's the little list of features that BioWare has thrown out so far in the press release:



* Embark upon an all-new adventure that takes place across an entire decade and shapes itself around every decision you make. 



* Determine your rise to power from a destitute refugee to the revered champion of the land.



* Think like a general and fight like a Spartan with dynamic new combat mechanics that put you right in the heart of battle whether you are a mage, rogue, or warrior.



* Go deeper into the world of Dragon Age with an entirely new cinematic experience that grabs hold of you from the beginning and never lets go.



* Discover a whole realm rendered in stunning detail with updated graphics and a new visual style.



The biggest change seems to be the combat. By the sounds of it, Dragon Age 2 will be more of an Action-RPG unlike its predecessor. I'm also intersested as to how they will tie in the events and characters of Origins. 



As I said, I'm a little nervous about the radical changes to the game that I loved, but BioWare has always delivered a quality product, and I'm sure this time is no different.



Now to patiently wait for that issue of Game Informer to come out to see the ten page story they got...
