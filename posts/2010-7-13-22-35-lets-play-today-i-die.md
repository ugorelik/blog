There are a lot of flash games out there, and I mean a lot. Being browser based, overpopulated and free it's hard to keep up with the more notable "Indie" games. So I was thinking, maybe every now and then I can post one of these games from start to finish. Well we'll see how it goes but for now here's Today I Die by Daniel Benmergui.



I love this game, it has great sound and it delivers so much with so little -- showcasing how something like a game can invoke emotion (well for me at least). Check out his other games at his blog [here][2] and I urge to skip the video and just try the game for [yourself][3].
