That's right you can pick up Machinarium for $5 this weekend. Where are your deals now Steam!? Thanks goes to [@edclef][3], original tweet: "Also note Machinarium is $5 this weekend, even for non-pirates. I would feel guilty about paying so little for something so wonderful"



For those of you who don't know, Machinarium is an indie point and click game with a great art style. Head on down to their [website][4] to buy the game or try the demo (which is also available on Steam).
