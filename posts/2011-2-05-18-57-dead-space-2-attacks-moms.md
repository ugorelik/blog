EA's new Dead Space 2 marketing campaigne is pretty funny. They sit a couple of 'moms' in front of some Dead Space 2 footage and tape their reactions. I have to say though, this add campaign is a bit strange though. I mean, who are they really targeting? Sure pissing off your parents was cool in like middle school but this is an M game so really the only people that should be playing this game aren't being targeted at all.
