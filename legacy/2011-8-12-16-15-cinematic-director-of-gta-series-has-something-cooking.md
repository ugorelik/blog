Navid Khonsari, the cinematic director of a couple of games you might know. Games like GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas. Well did you also know that he owns a production company called iNKstories? Did you know that iNKstoires has worked with Remedy Games to create the cinematic for Alan Wake? Yeah neither did I.



Well now iNKstories is going to be developing their own game title simply "1979."



Hit the jump to see the video iNKstories has release for this game.



It almost seems that the game is stepping off the wrong foot in a good way. If this game is done right, it's probably going to cause some, if not, a lot of controversy. But then again if it's done wrong and turns into a mediocre third person shooter that uses the events of the 1979 U.S. embassy hostage situation into a product.







The game will be a third person shooter, but the emphasis will not be on shooting, that is throughout the narrative will change. For example, the player will begin the game as a solider



Navid Khonsari explains further.



> The player must choose one of three historically inspired ways to enter Iran: By helicopter with a U.S. special forces team, through the Iraq border with Saddam Hussein's army or across the Afghanistan border with the Taliban.



This game has a lot of potential to be a serious game that could change the way people look at the video game industry. Oh well, we'll see what happens.
