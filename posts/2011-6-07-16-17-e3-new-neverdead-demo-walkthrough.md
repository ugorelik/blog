When I first saw NeverDead I was immediately intrigued. If you've never heard of NeverDead, skim through this video. I think you'll find it interesting. The gist of it is that you play as someone who was cursed with immortality. So you can't die but you can lose your limbs. Of course, you can just reattach them.



The game requires you use some pretty interesting mechanics. Like ripping off your arm and tossing it over towards some explosive barrels.
