Lately I've been using my USB stick a lot more than I usually do. Probably due to the fact that I'm using two computers. Before my USB phase came along, I would simply email myself attachments, or send myself the download links. That got pretty tedious pretty fast. So I dug through my pile of E3 sticks and found the Terra USB to be the most appealing. It wasn't long before I was download hefty files and installing small games on the it. I could carry JOYBLIND around in my pocket and make posts whenever. I could read my 15 mB document whenever I felt the urge. Life was pretty grand.



But alas, 'twas not perfect. I found myself having to keep the stick in sync whenever I edited one of the files it had to carry. And now this too became pretty tedious pretty fast. What was I to do? Be burdened by keeping my files up to date on two computers and a USB stick? Ridiculous!



Hit the jump to find out how I solved my disgusting situation! Or just [ get into it right away][3]!



Now enter Dropbox. What is Dropbox you ask? Well I'll tell you. Basically Dropbox is a USB stick that you don't have to carry around and that automatically syncs itself. Pretty damn nifty eh? Essentially how it works is you make an account and you get 2 gigs. So now you just got yourself a digital USB stick for free. From the login in page you can upload files, download your files, and one of the cooler features - send public links to your files to other people. From which others can download your linked files with no addition bandwidth cost to you.



Should you choose, you can also install their lightweight client (I did). This client simply adds a Dropbox folder somewhere on your PC. Now that folder will always be in sync with your Dropbox (so long as you have an internet connection). So let's take a look at this scenario. Say you're at your friends house and he/she shows you some great pictures. You want some of them but they're kinda big to send by email. What do you do? You upload them to your Dropbox and they're yours. Now when you get back home and turn on your computer those files will be sitting there waiting for you. You can then have this client over multiple computers and always have the files that are essential to you. So a change on one computer will be visible on the other(s).



I highly recommend you check it out. You can make an account [here][3]. That particular link is actually a reference to my Dropbox and every sign up from that link gets me a little more room :).



Small disclaimer: This article would have been written even if there were no benefits to sign-ups. It's really a good service and I don't wish to taint it by appearing to have ulterior motives. Now go get it!
