Jonathon Blow is a name that should be familiar to most gamers. Creator of Braid, Blow has a lot going for him. Blow set out to make Braid a couple of years ago pretty much by himself. About three years and 200k later, Braid was finally made. Now don't quote me on these timelines, they may be completely wrong, this is just what I remember from when I was reading some stuff about Blow.



Jonathon Blow's accomplishments are pretty impressive and are pretty much the dream of every indie game developper. Unless of course you're Markus Persson (creator of Minecraft) who's almost cleared $1,000,000 USD before even releasing his game. But that's for another time.

Naturally after Blow's success with Braid he has become a pretty prominent figure in the gaming industry. So when Mr. Blow is up to something new it should be pretty interesting. This brings me to The Witness -- his latest project. There isn't too much information about the actual gameplay; right now their blog focuses on the actually development of the game.



From what I've been able to gather The Witness is a puzzle game based in an island environment. It even looks like Myst but cooler. Hopefully there will be some updates or even some videos. But for now here are a couple of screens that I grabbed.
