Well it's official! The new PSP has been announced as NGP or the 'Next Generation Portable.' Now this may not be the official name Sony is going for since on their specification page they have it listed as a "codename."



Hit the jump for details.



The NGP packs some hefty features. It's sporting a touch screen first of all, which is almost a requirement in this day and age. But what's interesting is the NGP will also have a rear multi touch pad. I've heard countless people complain, wishing their controller would have buttons on the back to take their games to the "next level." This new tactile control system can open up a whole new demographic for Sony if they do it right. I mean, we all know it, the PSP sucked pretty hard, and then there was the PSP Go which was actually worse. But this NGP has caught my attention; on paper it looks a lot better than the 3DS which looks like a toy compared to this beast.

The NGP, as expected, will be able to connect to wireless and Bluetooth. And 3G. Whoa. Along with 3G the Six-axis motion control similar (maybe even better) to what we can find in a PS3 controller. But probably one of the biggest features for actual gaming that this baby has is its two analogue sticks (finally). And supposedly these are no nubs but pretty legit sticks.



In the end it really all comes down to the games. I know I personally don't need another 3G-enabled device to stream videos or to video chat with someone (oh yeah it also has a front and back camera). In my opinion the PSP has no good titles aside from Monster Hunters, MGS and a few others. That's where the 3DS will outperform it. And honestly the 3DS is lacking, I mean the 3D fad is already fading, so what? I'm going to pay 299.99 for another DS? Sadly there's no price point for the NGP, but I going to go ahead and say it's probably going to be within the 299.99-379.99 price range if not less. Anything above that is completely absurd.



Oh and one more thing. It can run PS3 games. You can check out the official spec page [here][4]
